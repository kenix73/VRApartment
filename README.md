How long it took to complete the project.
  - About 1 to 2 days of work.
One thing you liked about the project.
  - The fact that it explained triggers, which has been bugging me about how they work.
One thing that was particularly challenging about the project.
  - The baked lighting is still giving me fits.  I can't seem to make them work like I think they should.  I have most of it OK now, but it's still not easy.  I was hoping maybe someone could tell me how to properly light the globe (non-static) in the feedback, because I couldnt' get it except for as a directional light in real time.
